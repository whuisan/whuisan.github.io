## Projects
### **Database Project - DreamHaven Online Hotel Booking System**

📄 [View Full Report](docs/Group35_DBMS_Final_Assessment.pdf)  
📄 [Database Script (SQL)](docs/DBscript.sql)

> **Designed and implemented a relational database** for an online hotel booking platform using **Oracle SQL**. The project covered ERD modeling, relational schema design (Primary Key, Foreign Key, constraints, indexes), database implementation, and advanced SQL queries to answer business problems such as customer satisfaction, property performance, and high-value customer identification.

> **Skills gained:** Database design, SQL (joins, subqueries, aggregation, set operations, date functions), business data analysis, data integrity & optimization.



### **Predictive Modeling of Child Mortality Using Machine Learning in Python**

📄 [View Full Report](docs/SWA_Final_Report.pdf)  
📄 [Coding in Python](docs/SWA_Code(Google_Colab).py)

> This project applied **predictive analytics** to address child mortality among teenage mothers in Western Kenya using a dataset from Harvard Dataverse. **Built and compared multiple machine learning algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes and XGBoost) to estimate child mortality risk and support early interventions. The analysis was implemented in **Python** using **Google Colab**, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn and Matplotlib for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

> **Skills gained**: Python, Data Cleaning, Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, Data Visualization, Model Evaluation, Analytical Thinking.


### **Statistical Analysis of Sleep Health and Lifestyle Using SAS Enterprise Guide**

📄 [View Full Report](docs/Group_Assignment_Statistics.pdf)  
🔗 [Dataset Used](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)

> Conducted **statistical analysis** on a Kaggle dataset of 374 adults using **SAS Enterprise Guide** to examine the impact of lifestyle and health factors on sleep. The project applied descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing (one-sample, two-sample, ANOVA), and multiple linear regression to develop a predictive model for sleep duration.

> **Skills gained:** SAS programming, data cleaning, statistical inference, regression modeling, and interpretation of health-related insights.

📄 [System Test Document (STD)](docs/System_Test_Document_(STD).pdf)    
📄 [Final Report](docs/BIS_Final_Report.pdf)    

> Enhanced the *Sunway iZone Enrolment System*, a platform used by students for subject enrolment, by applying the **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. The project involved conducting surveys and referencing academic/industry sources to gather user requirements, followed by system design, prototype development, and testing.  **A functional prototype was developed using Figma**, while system reliability and usability were validated through pilot runs and user testing. The project concluded with a **formal pitch presentation** to peers and industry representatives.  

> **Skills gained:** System analysis & design (SDLC), requirements engineering, UML modeling, user research & referencing, usability testing, prototyping with Figma, teamwork & professional presentation.

📄 [Analysis & Strategy Report](docs/MAN3154_Mid-Term_Assignment.pdf)  
📄 [Prototype & Testing Report](docs/MAN3154_Final_Assignment.pdf)

> Analyzed ZUS Coffee and its competitors through **PESTLE analysis and a strategic group map**. Proposed and ranked five business strategies using Weighted Criteria Analysis, then developed three key solutions: Permanent In-App Minigames, ZUS GroupOrder+, and an AI-Powered Personalised Drink Recommender. **Prototypes were built in Figma**, tested through alpha and beta stages, and refined based on user feedback, with sustainability assessed using SusAF’s 5 Dimensions.

> **Skills gained:** Strategic industry analysis, business strategy evaluation, digital prototyping (Figma), user testing, and application of sustainability frameworks.
