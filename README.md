## Projects
**SQL Project - DreamHaven Online Hotel Booking System**

📄 [View Full Report](docs/Group35_DBMS_Final_Assessment.pdf)
📄 [Database Script (SQL)](docs/DBscript.sql)

**Designed and implemented a relational database** for an online hotel booking platform using Oracle SQL. The project covered ERD modeling, relational schema design (Primary Key, Foreign Key, constraints, indexes), database implementation, and advanced SQL queries to answer business problems such as customer satisfaction, property performance, and high-value customer identification.

**Skills gained:** Database design, SQL (joins, subqueries, aggregation, set operations, date functions), business data analysis, data integrity & optimization.


**Predictive Modeling of Child Mortality Using Machine Learning in Python**

📄 [View Full Report](docs/SWA_Final_Report.pdf)
📄 [Coding in Python](docs/SWA_Code(Google_Colab).py)

This project applied predictive analytics to address child mortality among teenage mothers in Western Kenya. The dataset, sourced from Harvard Dataverse, contained socio-economic and health-related variables and required extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure quality and consistency.

**Built and compared multiple machine learning algorithms**, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and XGBoost, to estimate child mortality risk and support early interventions. The entire analysis was implemented in Python using Google Colab, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

**Skills & Tools**: Python, Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Data Cleaning, Machine Learning, Data Visualization.


**Statistical Analysis of Sleep Health and Lifestyle Using SAS Enterprise Guide**

📄 [View Full Report](docs/Group_Assignment_Statistics.pdf)

Conducted statistical analysis on a Kaggle dataset of 374 adults using SAS Enterprise Guide to examine the impact of lifestyle and health factors on sleep. The project applied descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing (one-sample, two-sample, ANOVA), and multiple linear regression to develop a predictive model for sleep duration.

**Skills gained:** SAS programming, data cleaning, statistical inference, regression modeling, and interpretation of health-related insights.

📄 [Final Report](docs/BIS_Final_Report.pdf)  

Enhanced the *Sunway iZone Enrolment System*, a platform used by students for course enrolment and academic services, by applying the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The project involved conducting surveys and referencing academic/industry sources to gather user requirements, followed by system design, prototype development, and testing.  

Key deliverables included documentation (SRD, SDS, STD) and visual models such as use case diagrams, context diagrams, and data flow diagrams. A functional prototype was developed using **Figma**, while system reliability and usability were validated through pilot runs and user testing. The project concluded with a **formal pitch presentation** to peers and industry representatives.  

**Skills gained:** System analysis & design (SDLC), requirements engineering, UML modeling, user research & referencing, usability testing, prototyping with Figma, teamwork & professional presentation.

📄 [Analysis & Strategy Report] Performed PESTLE analysis, strategic group mapping, proposed and ranked five strategies, and assessed sustainability using SusAF’s 5 Dimensions.
📄 [Prototype & Testing Report] Developed three selected solutions, built Figma prototypes, and refined them through alpha and beta testing.

Analyzed ZUS Coffee and its competitors through PESTLE analysis and a strategic group map. Proposed and ranked five business strategies using Weighted Criteria Analysis, then developed three key solutions: Permanent In-App Minigames, ZUS GroupOrder+, and an AI-Powered Personalised Drink Recommender. Prototypes were built in Figma, tested through alpha and beta stages, and refined based on user feedback, with sustainability assessed using SusAF’s 5 Dimensions.

**Skills gained:** Strategic industry analysis, business strategy evaluation, digital prototyping (Figma), user testing, and application of sustainability frameworks.
